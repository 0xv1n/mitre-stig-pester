# Misc. things to review

## Priority: High

- [x] Rewrite all `$loop` unit tests to eliminate unnecesary `$setting` variable declaration and break if fail condition is met to prevent pass condition from overwriting. (0xv1n - 2022-10-30)

## Priority: Medium

## Priority: Low

- [ ] Review consistency of return values in assertions. `Should -Be 0` indicates pass condition met.

## Priority: Nice to have

- [ ] Output/Report generation include link to relevant fix.
